### Problem 1

##### Create a data frame comprised of:

-   random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   (length-10) character vector
-   (length-10) factor vector

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min=, max=5),
  vec_logic = (vec_numeric>2),
  vec_chr = c('a','b','c','a','b','c','a','b','c','a'),
  vec_factor = factor(c('a','b','c','a','b','c','a','b','c','a'))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logic vec_chr vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>     <chr>   <fct>     
    ##  1      4.06   TRUE      a       a         
    ##  2      4.02   TRUE      b       b         
    ##  3      4.53   TRUE      c       c         
    ##  4      1.92   FALSE     a       a         
    ##  5      2.85   TRUE      b       b         
    ##  6      2.44   TRUE      c       c         
    ##  7      3.20   TRUE      a       a         
    ##  8      0.908  FALSE     b       b         
    ##  9      0.0897 FALSE     c       c         
    ## 10      4.35   TRUE      a       a

##### Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?

``` r
mean(df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.836318

``` r
mean(df$vec_logic)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(df$vec_chr)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$vec_chr): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean function works for numeric and logic value (taking true as 1 and false as 0), but it does not work for characters and factor values, returning NA. The reason is that in this case the factors are in characters, so r cannot make this factor and the character column to a numeric value, hence returning NA for means.

##### In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?

``` r
as.numeric(df$vec_logic)
as.numeric(df$vec_chr)
as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
```

##### What happened is that:

-   the logical value is turned into: true = 1, false = 0
-   for the factor value, each level is automatically assigned value starting 1 to increasing integers
-   the character value gives the NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(df$vec_chr))
```

    ##  [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(df$vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

##### What happened is that:

-   'character to factor to numeric' returns numerical value, because characters can turned into factors, and then as.numeric assign numbers to each level of the factor.
-   'factor to character to numeric' returns NAs, because when factors are turned into characters, the as.numeric function will return NA for characters.
